## Rss Feed Small App

### School project developed in Java language for unit course "Programming Paradigms"

Several websites provide RSS feeds in order to simplify access and reading of the contents (in a summarized form). RSS Feeds are an easy way to view aggregated content from various sources such as blogs, forums or websites. Tools1 that use RSS are usually designated as aggregators, being responsible for consulting the content of the feeds and presenting that information to the user.

An RSS Feed provides information not only about the content issuer but also a set of items / messages that represent a summary of the content found in the original source.
The information is delivered as an XML file (Extensible Markup Language) with the name of RSS.

This project main goal is to implement an aggregator of RSS content (Really Simple Syndication), in other words, is to implement an API in Java language for an aggregator of RSS content
